# ðŸ”§ Sentrya System Improvements

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Detection Sensitivity Problems**
- **Issue**: Small movements were classified as erratic, too many false positives
- **Fix**: 
  - Increased erratic movement threshold: `30Â°` â†’ `60Â°`
  - Increased running speed threshold: `50` â†’ `80 pixels/frame`
  - Added minimum movement threshold: `15 pixels` before considering movement
  - Require `5+ frames` of stable tracking before behavioral analysis

### 2. **Confusing "Ghost" Labels**
- **Issue**: "Ghost" labels appeared when people stopped moving
- **Fix**: 
  - Removed confusing "ghost" labels
  - Added clear "Tracking (X)" status for new detections
  - Only show behaviors for stably tracked persons

### 3. **Tiny Zone Boxes**
- **Issue**: Default zones were too small for typical webcam resolutions
- **Fix**: 
  - Updated zones for 640x480 webcam resolution:
    - `center_area`: [200, 150, 520, 350] - Main monitoring area
    - `left_side`: [50, 100, 250, 400] - Left side coverage
    - `right_side`: [450, 100, 620, 400] - Right side coverage  
    - `entrance`: [250, 50, 450, 200] - Upper area (doorway)

### 4. **Multiple Person Count for Single Person**
- **Issue**: System counted 3 people when only 1 person present
- **Fix**:
  - Improved appearance matching threshold: `0.7` â†’ `0.5` (more lenient for webcam quality)
  - Added confidence filtering: minimum `0.3` detection confidence
  - Extended memory timeout: `5s` â†’ `8s` for better tracking continuity
  - Only count stably tracked persons (`5+ frames`)
  - Added proper ID cleanup when persons leave frame

## New Features Added

### **Enhanced Tracking Stability**
- Minimum detection confidence filtering
- Frame count tracking for each person
- Stable tracking requirement before behavioral analysis
- Better memory management and cleanup

### **Improved Movement Detection**
- Only analyze significant movements (15+ pixels)
- Use longer movement vectors for erratic detection
- Require multiple samples before speed analysis
- Reduced noise sensitivity

### **Better User Interface**
- Clear tracking status indicators
- Debug information display
- Removed confusing labels
- More informative person count

### **Webcam Optimization**
- Zones sized for typical webcam resolutions
- Better appearance matching for webcam quality
- Reduced false positives from camera shake
- More stable person re-identification

## Configuration Changes

```python
# New Detection Thresholds
SPEED_THRESHOLD = 80              # Was 50
ERRATIC_THRESHOLD = 60           # Was 30  
SUSPICIOUS_MEMORY_TIMEOUT = 5    # Was 3
memory_timeout = 8               # Was 5
appearance_match_threshold = 0.5  # Was 0.7

# New Parameters
MIN_DETECTION_CONFIDENCE = 0.3
MIN_MOVEMENT_THRESHOLD = 15
STABLE_TRACKING_FRAMES = 5
```

## Usage Notes

- **People Count**: Now shows "People Detected" with only stable tracked persons
- **Tracking Status**: New detections show "Tracking (X)" until stable
- **Zone Sizes**: Much larger zones suitable for webcam field of view
- **Sensitivity**: Less sensitive to small movements and camera shake
- **Reliability**: Better person re-identification reduces duplicate counting

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test with webcam**: Zones should now be properly sized
2. **Movement test**: Small movements should not trigger erratic detection
3. **Stability test**: Person count should remain stable for single person
4. **Zone test**: Zones should cover meaningful areas of your camera view
